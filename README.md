# Smart Parking Service

An app made by me for my friends last year major project. They created a mechanism that locks the bike into the place. With my app we can find parking spot for our bikes, we can search for location and spot from app. It was expensive to use Google API so i used Iframe instead of that for temporary purpose. In future in some months i will be integrating some more features in our App.
Our app is created using Reactjs and Bootstrap. We have also used React Routing for smooth user interaction.
